# SpaceX launch finder

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

It uses the open API provided by https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API to retrieve the launch information.

It's a simple app used to play around with Angular and the SpaceX API. It displays the latest launch, but also all past launches. It's also possible to filter and sort the launches.
